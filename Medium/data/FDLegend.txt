Note on stat string:
My license agreement with my stats provider prohibits me from directly passing along raw stats for each player in tabular form (in effect making me a stats provider), so instead I have provided a "stat string"  which lists the non-zero stats for each player, with each item delimited by spaces.
pt=points
rb=rebounds
as=assists
st=steals
bl=blocks
to=turnovers
trey=3 pointers made
fg=field goals made-attempted
ft=free throws made-attempted


File is typically updated by 6:00am ET each morning to include stats from the previous night.
One line is provided for each player for each previous game day.
Current day's games are also listed (salary and position data). This date for this pending contest data advances at 11pm each night.
